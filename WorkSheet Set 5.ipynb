    "goodness of fit model in regression and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) is a better measure to fit model in regression. The R-squared statistic isn’t perfect. Its value never decreases no matter the number of variables we add to our regression model. That is, even if we are adding redundant variables to the data, the value of R-squared does not decrease. It either remains the same or increases with the addition of new independent variables. This clearly does not make sense because some of the independent variables might not be useful in determining the target variable. Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) deals with this issue."

    "3. What is the need of regularization in machine learning? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Regularization reduces the variance of the model, without substantial increase in its bias. The tuning parameter λ, used in the regularization techniques, controls the impact on bias and variance. As the value of λ rises, it reduces the value of coefficients and thus reducing the variance. This increase in λ is beneficial as it is only reducing the variance, without loosing any important properties in the data."

It is based on the concept of entropy, which is the degree of impurity or uncertainty. It aims to decrease the level of entropy from the root nodes to the leaf nodes of the decision tree. "

OOB error is the mean prediction error on each training sample, using only the trees that did not have in their bootstrap sample. the number of iterations (trees) of the model (forest) should be considered to find the true OOB error. The OOB error will stabilize over many iterations so starting with a high number of iterations is a good idea."
